Amy's Winehouse Urged into Rehab

Amy's Winehouse has said "no no no" to calls to enter rehab after complaints of rowdy behaviour about the songstressly-named offy.

An neighbour, who wishes to remnain anonymous, has seen Amy's Winehouse selling the following in broad daylight:

Fine Wines & Champagnes
Rough Ciders & Spirits
Terry's Chocolate Orange, which no one ever seems to buy
Amy's Winehouse ain't got the time to make a comment, adding the retail outlet's daddy thinks she's fine.
