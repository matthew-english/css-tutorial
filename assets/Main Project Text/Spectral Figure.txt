Spectral Figure Found In Mowbray Park

Spirit Eyes Cannon

The Ghost of General Havlock appears to be considering using the canon left in Mowbray park - in protest at moving his bin collection to Tuesdays instead of Thursday.

The cannon, left pointing at the civic centre in case of another infestation of the Rage virus seems to be the target of the Victorian Millitaryman Shade's attentions .

When pressed, the wraith said "I'm buried at Lucknow, so getting here to put the bins out for Tuesday is impossible, the connecting flights just aren't there."

Queen Victoria, Greyfriars Bobby and Sunderland City council were unavailable for comment.
