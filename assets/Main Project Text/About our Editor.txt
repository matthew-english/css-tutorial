About our Editor

Our cheif editor, Ahab McRadgie has had a long career in the media, despite his youth. Starting off taxing dafties for 20p, who he assured he needed the money to get home to his dying grandmother. He soon set to work selling the Big Issue, then graduated on to harder, more potent local newspapers.
Ahab has been given a Regional Press Award for his scoop "Ryhope man catches train" and a restraining order after the incident with the inflatible crocodile, the vodka and small arms we don't talk about, but none one will ever forget. Even though we tried hard. So, so hard.
